Or, you can use the following command from the project root `touch resources/views/about/me.blade.php`\r\n\r\n## Registration\r\n\r\nSet `APP_REGISTER=true` in your **.env** file to enable user registration.\r\n\r\n## Filesystem Cloud Storage Symlink\r\n\r\nThis project uses the Filesystem/Cloud storage component of Laravel, as such you need to set up the symlink for the photos to be publicly available.\r\n\r\n> The public disk is meant for files that are going to be publicly accessible. By default, the public disk uses the local \r\n> driver and stores these files in **storage/app/public**. To make them accessible from the web, you should create a symbolic \r\n> link from **public/storage** to **storage/app/public**.\r\n\r\nSo, like this ... starting from the **/blog/public** directory`ln -s ../storage/app/public storage`\r\n\r\n",
